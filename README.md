# AutoFeedback
I made this project summer of 2024 going into my sophomore year of college. On many fast food receipts they give you the option to fill out a survey to give feedback and in return they will give you a code for free/discounted food. These surveys can be annoying so I made this project to automate this task and to get you your free food faster.
